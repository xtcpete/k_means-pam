# K_means and pam Clustering
 
This repository contains k-means and k-mediod algorithms for clustering, and a evaluation metrics for contigency matrix and adjusted rand index for evaluating the algorithm.

## Test Algorithms
Both algorithms are tested under stimulation experimentï¼š

60 data points are sampled form the following distributions each with random seed 20

to then concantenate these points sequentially to form a sample of size  180.

Fit both algorithms with the stimulated data, the resaults are:
k_means method acheive a ARS of 0.783 and the plot

pam method acheive a ARS of 0.743 with parameter p=2 and the plot

All data used for testing are under folder ref_data 

  sim.csv - stimulated data
