# K_means and pam Clustering
 
This repository contains k-means algothrim and k-mediod algothrim for clustering, and a evaluation metrics for contigency matrix and adjusted rand index for evaluating the algothrim.

## Test Algothrims
Both algothrims are tested under stimulation experimentï¼š

60 data points are sampled form the following distributions each

to then concantenate these points sequentially to form a sample of size  180.

k_means method acheive a ARS of 0.783 and the plot as follows:

pam method acheive a ARS of 0.743 with parameter p=2 and the plot as follows:
